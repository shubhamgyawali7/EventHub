# Binary Search & Auto-Suggestion Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for implementing a high-performance search suggestion system for the EventHub events page, similar to YouTube or Amazon.

## 1. Core Logic: The Binary Search
Binary search requires the data to be sorted. We will sort the events by title once the data is fetched.

### How it works:
Standard binary search finds one exact item. To get **suggestions**, we need a modified version that finds the **range** of all events starting with the typed prefix.

```javascript
// Conceptual logic for prefix searching
const findRange = (arr, prefix) => {
    let low = 0;
    let high = arr.length - 1;
    let first = -1;

    // Find the first occurrence of the prefix
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        const titlePrefix = arr[mid].title.toLowerCase().substring(0, prefix.length);
        
        if (titlePrefix === prefix.toLowerCase()) {
            first = mid;
            high = mid - 1; // Keep looking left to find the absolute start
        } else if (arr[mid].title.toLowerCase() < prefix.toLowerCase()) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    if (first === -1) return [];

    // Collect all matches starting from 'first' index
    const results = [];
    for (let i = first; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i].title.toLowerCase().startsWith(prefix.toLowerCase())) {
            results.push(arr[i]);
        } else {
            break; // Stop as soon as it doesn't match (since it's sorted)
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```

## 2. Component State Changes
We will add the following states to `Events.jsx`:
- `suggestions`: Array to hold the filtered results.
- `showDropdown`: Boolean to toggle the visibility of the suggestion box.
- `highlightIndex`: Integer to track which suggestion is selected via keyboard (Up/Down arrows).

## 3. UI/UX Design (Premium Look)
The suggestion box will be positioned absolutely below the search bar with these characteristics:

- **Glassmorphism:** Slight blur and transparency (`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`).
- **Micro-interactions:** Smooth hover states, transitions, and subtle entry animations.
- **Keyboard Friendly:** Use `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, and `Enter` to select suggestions without a mouse.
- **Bold Matching:** The part of the title that matches the search term will be visually distinct.

## 4. Proposed File Changes
- **`client/src/pages/public/Events.jsx`**: 
    - Wrap the search input in a `relative` container.
    - Add the Suggestion List component.
    - Implement the `handleKeyDown` and `handleSearchChange` functions.
- **`client/src/utils/eventSorter.js`**:
    - Add a helper to ensure events are always alphabetized before searching.

## 5. Benefits
1. **Performance:** Search happens in $O(\log N)$ time, which is nearly instant regardless of list size.
2. **Professional Feel:** Real-time suggestions make the app feel modern and fast.
3. **Accessibility:** Full keyboard support allows power users to navigate quickly.
