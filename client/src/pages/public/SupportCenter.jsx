      {
        q: "Is EventHub free to use?",
        a: "Yes. Creating a student account, browsing events, and registering for free events costs nothing. Some events organized by third-party clubs may have their own registration fees set by the organizer — EventHub is not responsible for those charges.",
      },

        q: "Which districts does EventHub cover?",

      {
        q: "Can I cancel my registration?",

      },
      {
        q: "What do 'Trending' and 'Urgent' badges mean?",
        a: "'Trending' indicates an event with a high registration count relative to its seat capacity — it is popular among students. 'Urgent' means the registration deadline is approaching within 48 hours. These badges are assigned automatically by our prioritization algorithm.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I sync events to Google Calendar?",

      {
        q: "How do I export participant data?",

      },
      {
        q: "How is my data protected?",
        a: "All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs. Authentication sessions are managed via HTTP-only JWT cookies to prevent XSS attacks. Data is stored in a secured MongoDB Atlas cluster with access controls. We never sell your personal data.",
