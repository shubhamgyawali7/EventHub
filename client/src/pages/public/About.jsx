            EventHub is a centralized event discovery and management platform built for students across Nepal. It
            connects students with academic, technical, cultural, and professional events happening in different cities
            and institutions nationwide.

            <p className="text-[#475569] leading-relaxed">
              Our mission is simple — ensure that no student misses an opportunity. By centralizing events from multiple
              institutions and cities, EventHub makes discovering and participating in events organized, accessible, and
              efficient.

              Organizers create and manage events through a dedicated dashboard, while students browse and filter events
              based on location and interest. This structured, role-based system ensures clarity, simplicity, and smooth
              event coordination.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-[#4F46E5] text-center mb-10">Why We Built EventHub</h2>

          <div className="text-[#475569] leading-relaxed space-y-6 text-center md:text-left">
            <p>
              During our early semesters, we often missed valuable opportunities like hackathons, workshops, webinars,
              and technical competitions. Not because they didn’t exist — but because we didn’t know about them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Different IT clubs and student associations across Nepal were organizing amazing events, yet information
              was scattered across multiple social media platforms. To stay updated, students had to follow and
              regularly check each club’s social media separately — which was time-consuming and overwhelming.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of this fragmented system, we missed registration deadlines and discovered events too late. We
              realized the problem wasn’t the lack of events — it was the lack of a centralized system.
            </p>

            <p>
              That personal experience became the foundation of our final year project. We envisioned a platform where
              students across Nepal could discover all IT-related events in one place — searchable, filterable by
              location, and organized clearly.
            </p>

            <p className="font-medium text-gray-900">
              EventHub exists to ensure that no student misses an opportunity simply because information was scattered.
